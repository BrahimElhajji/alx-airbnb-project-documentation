# User Stories - Airbnb Clone Backend

## 📌 Objective
This section provides user stories derived from the system’s use case diagram. These user stories help bridge the gap between system design and development by describing real-world scenarios that the backend must support.

## 📜 Summary
The `user-stories.md` file contains detailed stories from the perspectives of:
- Guests
- Hosts
- Admins (optional/future use)

These stories define how users interact with the system and what functionalities the backend must provide.

## 🧩 Examples
- **Guest**: “As a guest, I want to book a property so that I can reserve a place to stay.”
- **Host**: “As a host, I want to manage my listings so that I can update property details.”

## 🚀 Purpose
User stories guide the development team by breaking down system interactions into human-centered goals, making backend implementation more intuitive and testable.
